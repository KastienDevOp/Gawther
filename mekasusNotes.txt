ANY PARTS OF SENTENCES SURROUNDED IN * ARE MARKED FOR KATAREBORN AS THOSE ARE 
FUNCTIONS/METHODS/MODULES THAT HE IS WORKING ON. THEY JUST SO HAPPEND TO 
BLEND WITH WHAT I AM WORKING ON AS WELL.

    **Currently Doing**
        -*LockDown*
            - all channels become 100% inaccessible to anyone who is not
              the Head Admin, Gawther Dev Team Supervisor, Or Owner Of 
              Gawther.
                
            - create override feature only usable by Mekasu, KataReborn,
              or GamingBuddhist

        -*channel back up feature*
            - iterates through each category, and categories channels to 
              obtain message, message author, message created at, category,
              and channel to be written to off-site storage to be re-implimented
              once re-construction of Gawther has finished.

            - iterates through Gawthers current storage features, creates a 
              "copy" and then destroys all storage features after creating 
              a new storage feature using fresh information that is NOT 
              linked to copied information whatsoever. Read from A, Write To B.
              No Link.

        -creating a server template.
            - In the event that discord was to ever have a server failure, 
              or for some odd reason Gawther (server) was to fail, I am 
              creating a template that will recreate our community for us.
              From replacing roles with permissions to recreating text
              channels and categories.
              
    **Currently In Testing**
        - server template.

    **Tried Tested and True**
        - reset server command.
            - this command will clone and delete each channel and category within the
              discord server and places them back in their proper categories in the 
              position in which they came from 

    **Coming In The Future**
        - support ticket extension
        
            - create ticket creator command 
            - create global programming language help commands
                - do not webscrape mekasu -Mekasu 
            - create support staff commands
