    **Currently Doing**
        -generating gawther server template in case of bot/person hack
            -LockDown
                - all channels become 100% inaccessible to anyone who is not
                  the Head Admin, Gawther Dev Team Supervisor, Or Owner Of 
                  Gawther.
                
                - create override feature only usable by Mekasu, KataReborn,
                  or GamingBuddhist

            -*channel back up feature*
                - iterates through each category, and categories channels to 
                  obtain message, message author, message created at, category,
                  and channel to be written to off-site storage to be re-implimented
                  once re-construction of Gawther has finished.

                - iterates through Gawthers current storage features, creates a 
                  "copy" and then destroys all storage features after creating 
                  a new storage feature using fresh information that is NOT 
                  linked to copied information whatsoever. Read from A, Write To B.
                  No Link.

            -Clean up 
                - iterates through each category, and category channel and 
                  deletes them as it goes.
                - iterates through every role within the server, and deletes 
                  them as it goes.
            
            - Re-Construction 
                - recreates each role, and rewrites the permissions to those 
                  that existed before LockDown.
                
                - recreates each channel and category while setting each 
                  categories permissions for each role.

                - takes chat backup, and re-impliments the chat messages
                  back into the corresponding chat channels in an embed
                  format, or other format that is appealing to the eye
                  while keeping the channels clean.

                    - second option: leave chats in storage. do not re-impliment. 
                      create search command that will search through previous 
                      chats and return the results to the user in their dms.

                        - search range is done by date, time frame, member name.
                          return all members messages, or entire conversation from 
                          when member sent initial message to last message within 
                          time frame.
